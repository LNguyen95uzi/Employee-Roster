# Employee-Roster

![](employee.gif)

This application helps a manager or employee create an easy team roster! Managers, engineers, and interns are all currently listable but can be changed easily to fit other titles. The user will run the application in the command prompt which will ask a series of questions to gather necessary information to fill out the roster.
